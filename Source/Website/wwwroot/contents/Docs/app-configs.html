<p>Learn how to manage ImageGlass using configuration files, defining presets, and even locking specific settings during installation.</p>
<h2 id="configuration-directories">Configuration directories</h2>
<p>When dealing with the working directories in ImageGlass, it's essential to understand two key phrases:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Startup directory (Startup Dir)</strong>: This directory is where ImageGlass.exe is located, also known as the installation directory. For example: <code>C:\Program Files\ImageGlass\</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Configuration directory (Config Dir)</strong>: This directory houses the ImageGlass settings file (igconfig.json) and other related files. It's typically located in <code>%LocalAppData%\ImageGlass\</code>. In portable mode, the Config Dir is the same as the Startup Dir. If ImageGlass lacks write permissions in the Startup Dir, it will use <code>%LocalAppData%\ImageGlass\</code> instead.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="manage-imageglass-using-configuration-files">Manage ImageGlass using configuration files</h2>
<p>ImageGlass recognizes three distinct configuration files, which are loaded in the following sequence:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>igconfig.default.json</code>: Located in the Startup Dir, this file specifies default settings that are used if no other settings are available upon the initial launch.</li>
<li><code>igconfig.json</code>: Found in the Config Dir, this file contains all user-specific settings and is written by ImageGlass after the application is closed. It takes precedence over the settings in the <code>igconfig.default.json</code> file.</li>
<li><code>igconfig.admin.json</code>: Located in the Startup Dir, this file contains settings that will override all settings in the files mentioned above.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, ImageGlass supports passing settings as command-line arguments. Each command must begin with a <code>/</code>. For instance, to launch ImageGlass without the toolbar and gallery, and with an Acrylic backdrop:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">ImageGlass.exe /ShowToolbar=false /ShowGallery=false /WindowBackdrop=&quot;Acrylic&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>ImageGlass systematically searches for these files in the described order and locations. The configuration is constructed from scratch, setting by setting, following these four steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>It starts with the defaults set by the developer.</li>
<li>If an <code>igconfig.default.json</code> is found and contains relevant settings, it overrides the values from step 1.</li>
<li>If an <code>igconfig.json</code> is found and contains the relevant settings, it overrides the values from step 2.</li>
<li>If the user passes settings as command-line arguments, they override the values from step 3.</li>
<li>If an <code>igconfig.admin.json</code> is found and contains relevant settings, it will override the values from step 4.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once every setting in the complete configuration is processed, ImageGlass will use the resulting configuration and write the entire configuration to its <code>igconfig.json</code> file (and only there). This ensures that your chosen settings are preserved for future use.</p>
