<h2 id="general-changes">General Changes</h2>
<p>ImageGlass 9.0 RC addresses a vulnerability related to WebP files (<a href="https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-j7hp-h8jx-5ppr" target="_blank" ref="noopener nofollow">CVE-2023-4863</a>). It introduces support for .NET 8 and ARM64 builds. The new Color dialog allows you to pick alpha values. You can now open a new image window easily with 'File &gt; New window.' It also offers the ability to disable menus, an 'EnableDebug' setting, and improved mouse click actions.</p>
<h2 id="quick-setup-dialog">Quick Setup Dialog</h2>
<p>This version replaces the First-launch configurations with a user-friendly Out-of-box experience wizard. It includes two setting profiles for different user needs and allows you to control the Quick Setup dialog display.</p>
<h2 id="app-settings">App Settings</h2>
<p>You can now toggle the ImageGlass icon on the title bar with the new 'Show app icon on the title bar' setting. The UI for settings like <code>ImageInfoTags</code>, <code>EditApps</code>, <code>ToolbarButtons</code> and more has been enhanced for user convenience. File type associations settings are improved, and a &quot;Get help&quot; floating button provides quick access to documentation.</p>
<p>Additionally, the UI for <code>ZoomLevels</code> has been refined, and &quot;ImageGlass&quot; is no longer added to the file type when setting it as the default photo viewer.</p>
<h2 id="gallery-component">Gallery Component</h2>
<p>ImageGlass 9.0 fixes issues related to the thumbnail cache, ensuring it doesn't reset and adheres to the specified size limit.</p>
