<p>ImageGlass 7.6 is the second release in 2020 - 10th anniversary. This update contains new features, fixes and being rolled out amid the Coronavirus pandemic. Let's stay safe!</p>
<h2 id="cropping-tool">Cropping tool</h2>
<p>You now can select a region of the viewing image in ImageGlass with Cropping tool. This also allows to save and copy the selection to clipboard. Besides that, you can manually adjust the crop factors: X, Y, Width, Height from tool window.</p>
<p>Cropping tool does not support multi-page / multi-frame image formats (GIF, TIFF). You can only select the visible page/frame of the viewing image. Also, any modification on image may cause losing meta data and quality.</p>
<h2 id="read-and-write-base64-formats">Read and write Base64 formats</h2>
<p>ImageGlass 7.6 adds more supports on base64 formats using <code>.b64</code> extension. The conversion from image to base64 can be made up to 8 MIME types:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>image/gif</code>: animation supported.</li>
<li><code>image/tiff</code>: multi-page supported.</li>
<li><code>image/webp</code>: animation supported (*).</li>
<li><code>image/svg+xml</code>: scaling supported (*).</li>
<li><code>image/bmp</code>, <code>image/jpeg</code>, <code>image/x-icon</code></li>
<li><code>image/png</code>: all other image formats will be saved as PNG base64.</li>
</ul>
<p>(*) - <em>copy the base64 content and open in browser</em>.</p>
<p>The conversion from base64 back to image format is limited:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does not support multi-page / multi-frame. Only the first page / frame supported.</li>
<li>Converting image/svg+xml to SVG causes pixelated.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="title-bar-shows-more-information">Title bar shows more information</h2>
<p>ImageGlass displays color profile (if any) of the viewing image on title bar. In addition, image file date time is now either:</p>
<ul>
<li>EXIF <code>DateTimeOriginal</code> with suffix <code>(o)</code>, or</li>
<li>EXIF <code>DateTime</code> without suffix, or</li>
<li><code>LastModifiedTime</code> with suffix <code>(m)</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="simplify-shortcuts-of-imageglass">Simplify shortcuts of ImageGlass</h2>
<p>We standardized and simplified lots of shortcuts in ImageGlass 7.6 which, we believe, is easier to remember. You only need to press a key most of the time instead of a key combo.</p>
<p>For details, please refer to <a href="https://imageglass.org/docs/ui-shortcuts-reference">UI shortcuts reference</a>.</p>
<h2 id="slideshow-improvement">Slideshow improvement</h2>
<p>We added an option to allow people to play slideshow in random interval. This feature is requested by lots of artists.</p>
<p>You can go to Settings &gt; Image tab, scroll to Slideshow group, then check the option &quot;Use random interval&quot;. Here you can specify your interval range from 1 second up to 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Besides, ImageGlass 7.6 also keeps computer awake while in slideshow mode. It means your screen will not be turned off or put into sleep mode after being idle for a few minutes.</p>
<h2 id="performance-improvement">Performance improvement</h2>
<p>We fixed a bug which made ImageGlass takes 4 times slower to load TIFF and the images that contain color profile. This bug comes from our third-party library Magick.NET.</p>
<h2 id="download-it-now">Download it now!</h2>
