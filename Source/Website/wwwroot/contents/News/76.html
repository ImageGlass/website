<h2 id="support-new-image-formats">Support new image formats</h2>
<p>WEBP animated format is supported! Other formats come to this release are <code>FITS</code>, <code>XV</code>, <code>VIFF</code>, <code>MJPEG</code>,...</p>
<h2 id="new-feature-share">New feature: Share</h2>
<p>You can share the viewing image or even the image data that you pasted to ImageGlass by the new Share feature. It works on Windows 10 or later. You can find this feature in <strong>Main menu &gt; File &gt; Share..</strong>., or press the hotkey <kbd>S</kbd>.</p>
<h2 id="support-for-image-transparency-copypaste">Support for image transparency copy/paste</h2>
<p>In the previous versions, ImageGlass was unable to copy the alpha pixels to clipboard, or display it from clipboard paste function. Managing clipboard data in Windows is complicated and inconsistent, version 8.6 supports the most common way to support this by writing / reading from 4 clipboard data formats: <code>CF_BITMAP</code>, <code>CF_DIB</code>, <code>PNG</code>, <code>System.Drawing.Bitmap</code>. For those third-party softwares support writing / reading <code>PNG</code>, <code>CF_DIB</code> from the clipboard, its image transparency data will work on ImageGlass 8.6.</p>

<p>Image panning speed customization is supported in the version 8.6, a big thank to <a href="https://github.com/siblount" target="_blank" ref="noopener nofollow">@Solomon Blount</a>'s contribution. You can change it in <strong>Settings &gt; Image &gt; Panning</strong>.</p>
<p>Besides that, in the Windows fit mode, when you zoom the viewing image, the window size is also scaled to adapt the image size accordingly - an awesome contribution from <a href="https://github.com/SylwesterZarebski" target="_blank" ref="noopener nofollow">@Sylwester Zarębski</a>! ImageGlass 8.6 also contains bug fixes to make it works better on Windows 11.</p>
