<p>ImageGlass 8.2 is a small but critical update, it improves the stability, contains bugfixes, feature improvements.</p>
<h2 id="support-printing-multi-page-tiff">Support printing multi-page TIFF</h2>
<p>Printing in ImageGlass is now enhanced with multi-page support for TIF/TIFF format. You just press <kbd>Ctrl+P</kbd> to print the image, there will be an option to allow you to choose which page of TIF/TIFF file to print. ImageGlass uses &quot;Print Picture&quot; dialog of Windows OS to perform printing the viewing image.</p>
<h2 id="support-relative-path-for-editing-app">Support relative path for Editing app</h2>
<p>ImageGlass does not have many editing tools, but it provides options to integrate thrid-party apps for this purpose. In v8.2, you can use relative path, or protocol to execute the editing app. This is especially useful when you want to open the viewing image with Windows Store apps which often hide its location and use protocal to launch. Refer to <a href="https://github.com/d2phap/ImageGlass/issues/945" target="_blank" ref="noopener nofollow">this ticket</a> for further information.</p>
<p>Besides that, you can also select multiple extensions to assign an app for editing.</p>
<h2 id="critical-bugfixes">Critical bugfixes</h2>
<p>We addressed a lot of critical bugs in this update. Some of them are related to image saving functions (Save / Save as / Crop / Flip / ...). An issue reported by many people, when opening an image, it pops up the message &quot;Reached the first image&quot; and only shows a blank screen until you navigate to other files, also fixed!</p>
