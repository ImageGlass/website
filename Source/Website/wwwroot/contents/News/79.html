<h2 id="changes-for-magick.net-library">Changes for Magick.NET library</h2>
<p>ImageGlass has been using Magick.NET Q16 to read the image formats since version 4.0. In version 8.7, we changed to <a href="https://github.com/dlemstra/Magick.NET/tree/main/docs#q8-q16-or-q16-hdri" target="_blank" ref="noopener nofollow">Magick.NET Q16-HDRI</a> for more precise and better quality output. As a result, it requires a bit more memory for reading the image because it uses a floating point (32 bits-per-pixel component) and allows out-of-bound pixels (less than 0 and more than 65,535).</p>
<p>This change applies to the 64-bit release of ImageGlass 8.7. If you need a more lightweight version, you can download the 32-bit release.</p>
<h2 id="support-dark-mode-for-title-bar">Support dark mode for title bar</h2>
<p>Version 8.7 adds an option to theme pack config file (igconfig.xml) to enable dark (or light) mode of the title bar. You should <a href="https://imageglass.org/themes">update your theme packs</a> to enjoy the seamless color in the app.</p>
<p>To learn more about the theme pack, you can visit: <a href="https://github.com/ImageGlass/theme" target="_blank" ref="noopener nofollow">https://github.com/ImageGlass/theme</a>.</p>
<h2 id="support-setting-sub-second-slideshow-interval">Support setting sub-second slideshow interval</h2>
<p>In version 8.6, you can only set the slideshow interval by a second. <a href="https://github.com/d2phap/ImageGlass/pull/1393" target="_blank" ref="noopener nofollow">The contribution of @BenHUET</a> makes it possible to use milliseconds for the slideshow interval. You can enter a decimal number into the slideshow interval textbox, click OK or Apply button to apply the change.</p>
