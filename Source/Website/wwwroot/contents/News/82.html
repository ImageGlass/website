<h2 id="faster-animated-webp-loading">Faster animated WebP loading</h2>
<p>ImageGlass' WebP format decoder has had a big improvement to the animated format by directly using libwebp v1.3 (not through Magick.NET anymore).</p>
<h2 id="exiftool-improvements">Exiftool improvements</h2>
<p>In this update, ImageGlass has made significant improvements to its Exiftool functionality.</p>
<p>Firstly, the software now supports the use of a relative path for the exiftool.exe file. This allows for more flexibility and ease of use when working with the Exiftool feature. Secondly, ImageGlass has added support for displaying and extracting Unicode characters from EXIF metadata, enabling users to access and view metadata in a wider range of languages.</p>
<h2 id="changes-in-saving-image-behaviours">Changes in saving image behaviours</h2>
<p>Please note that ImageGlass is not designed to be a professional photo editor, and when saving image files with the app, you may lose file metadata, layers, and quality. In this version, ImageGlass is restricted to only saving the formats listed on our website: <a href="https://imageglass.org/docs/supported-formats">https://imageglass.org/docs/supported-formats</a> (under the &quot;Write&quot; column). If you attempt to save an unsupported format, the &quot;Save as&quot; dialog will open instead. This restriction is in place to prevent your image file from becoming corrupted or losing data. We recommend using a professional photo editor for more advanced image editing tasks.</p>
<p>If you make changes to the viewing image and then navigate to the next one, ImageGlass will not automatically save the changes. Instead, a prompt will appear asking if you want to save the changes before moving to the next image. This step is necessary to prevent the image from becoming corrupted if the saving process is interrupted by exiting the app. Please be sure to save your changes before moving to the next image.</p>
