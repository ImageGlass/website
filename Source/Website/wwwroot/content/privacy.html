<h2 id="software">Software</h2>
<p>There are currently two (2) releases of ImageGlass: &quot;Microsoft Store&quot; and &quot;Classic&quot;. The Microsoft Store release is available on Microsoft Store while the Classic release is downloadable from this website.</p>
<p>Both releases of ImageGlass will anonymously append a query string when you open a link from the software to this website. This allows us to count how many installations there are for each version of ImageGlass, and how many install/update attempts were successful or not.</p>

<h3 id="classic-release">Classic release</h3>
<p>ImageGlass, as a software, periodically checks for updates. This is done by downloading a small file from the website and is anonymous. You can disable this from the Settings dialog.</p>
