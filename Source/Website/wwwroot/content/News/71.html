<h2 id="jpeg-xl-format-support">JPEG XL format support</h2>
<p>JXL format is now added to the built-in list. If you are upgrading from older version, you may need to manually add these formats in Settings &gt; File type associations tab.</p>
<p>You also can add other formats listed at <a href="https://imagemagick.org/script/formats.php#supported" target="_blank" ref="noopener nofollow">https://imagemagick.org/script/formats.php#supported</a></p>
<h2 id="exif-viewer-tool-improvement">EXIF viewer tool improvement</h2>
<p>Exif tool in ImageGlass is a wrapper of <a href="https://exiftool.org" target="_blank" ref="noopener nofollow">https://exiftool.org</a>, developed by Phil Harvey. You need to download the Windows executable version on its website, unzip and rename <code>exiftool(-k).exe</code> to <code>exiftool.exe</code>. Then, import this file to ImageGlass by going to Settings &gt; Tools &gt; Exif tool, clicking on Select Exif tool file link button.</p>
<p>In this update, you can pass custom parameters to the exiftool, by going to Settings &gt; Tools &gt; Exif tool &gt; Command arguments, and you can see the preview of the command in the Command preview box.</p>
<h2 id="more-interpolation-options-for-zoom-optimization">More interpolation options for Zoom Optimization</h2>
<p>We implemented this feature according to a request. For those who need professional zooming feature, you can check the new options added: Low / high quality, Bilinear, Bicubic, Nearest-neighbor,...</p>
<h2 id="save-image-vs-save-image-as">Save image vs Save image as...</h2>
<p>We made a breaking change for saving method of ImageGlass 8.1. &quot;Save image&quot; will override the current viewing image file (if possible) while &quot;Save image as...&quot; will always open Save file dialog. When you work with image data (clipboard), &quot;Save image&quot; works as &quot;Save image as...&quot; feature.</p>
