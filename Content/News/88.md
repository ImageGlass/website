## Upgrading to version 9
Before upgrading to ImageGlass 9, please take note of the following changes:

### Removed features

::: { .box .box-warning .mb-3 }
⚠️ If you were enabling the setting **"Start with OS to improve startup speed"**, make sure to <u>disable it before</u> upgrading to version 9.
:::


### Breaking changes
- User config files are now in the JSON format: `igconfig.json`. ImageGlass 9 cannot import settings from version 8.
- Similarly, theme and language pack also updated to use JSON format. You can download theme packs for version 9 at [Download / Theme packs](https://imageglass.org/themes).
- For power users:
  + Version 9 uses **Per-user setting** model which is different from **Per-machine setting** of version 8:
    - The app settings are now saved in the `%LocalAppData%` folder. Refer to [Docs / App configuration](https://imageglass.org/docs/app-configs) for more information.
    - The app registry uses `HKEY_CURRENT_USER` for file type associations and app protocol.
  + `igtasks.exe` has been removed.
  + All commands in `igcmd.exe` have been reworked. Visit [Docs / Command line utilities](https://imageglass.org/docs/command-line-utilities) for the updated information.
  + To skip the **"ImageGlass Quick Setup"** dialog, set `QuickSetupVersion` value to any number greater than `9` in the `igconfig.json` file.


## Performance boost with hardware acceleration
ImageGlass 9's rendering engine now leverages GPU technology, resulting in significantly improved performance and image quality. Enjoy smooth zooming and panning even for large image dimensions and animated formats.

Additionally, the use of the newer version of .NET has reduced ImageGlass's startup time, eliminating the need to start with the OS.


## The new modern, fluent, intuitive interface
ImageGlass 9 seamlessly combines functionality with a beautiful design, and it offers customization options to suit your preferences. Two modern theme packs, `Kobe` and `Kobe - Light`, come pre-installed. Seamlessly switch between light and dark mode based on your system settings.

Moreover, Windows 11 users can enjoy transparent backdrop styles, including Mica, Mica Alt, and Acrylic.

## Enhanced SVG viewing
