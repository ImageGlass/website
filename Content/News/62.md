![ImageGlass 5.0](https://github.com/ImageGlass/config/blob/main/screenshots/v5.0/5.0_1.jpg?raw=true)

ImageGlass keeps getting better - the version 5 includes new innovations, features and bug fixes.

## New First-Launch Configurations screen
helps you to quickly set up on the first launch of ImageGlass. You can select your language, layout mode, theme; or set ImageGlass as default photo viewer.

The Layout mode contains two options:
- Standard: all the configs are set as same as the previous version of ImageGlass
- Designer: will optimize the layout and mouse shortcuts for designer, such as horizontal scrolling, vertical scrolling...


## Color Picker tool
ImageGlass 5 supports Color Picker tool which allows you to pick a color of the viewing image, and automatically convert it to 4 color formats: RGBA, HEXA, CMYK and HSL.

You can toggle the tool by pressing <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+K</kbd> or opening the *Main menu* > *Tools* > *Color Picker*.


## Customizable toolbar buttons
I received so many requests to implement this feature and finally it comes with ImageGlass 5.0, thanks to Kevin Routley - my new collaborator.

To customize the toolbar buttons, you can go toSettings dialog > Toolbar.


## Enhanced files real-time update
ImageGlass 5 will instantly update the viewing image, as well as the images in the viewing folder, if you make change on it. This also includes thumbnail bar.


## Other enhancements
Save the viewing image with lossless quality (depending on the format).
Ability to copy image data on the viewer.
Instantly apply the configurations if you make any changes.
