## Customize Zoom levels
An option in Settings dialog helps you to customize your zoom levels. The level value should be in range from 5 to 3500.


## Follow Windows File Explorer sort order
With this feature enabled in Settings dialog, ImageGlass will load image files in the same order of Windows File Explorer. You can drag-n-drop images to ImageGlass window; to manually update the image list, you can go to Main menu > File > Reload image list.

It only works if the image folder is opening!


## The new core library of ImageGlass
ImageGlass 7 come with a big improvement of core library. You can change the number of images cached with ImageBooster in Settings dialog, depending on how powerful your RAM is.


## Web-to-App linking
ImageGlass 7 also allows you to view local images file/folder from a website by supporting a special protocol `imageglass:path`.

This protocol is also enabled when user registers default photo app in Windows OS. Check the video for more information.
