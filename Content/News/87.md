## General Changes
ImageGlass 9.0 RC addresses a vulnerability related to WebP files ([CVE-2023-4863](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-j7hp-h8jx-5ppr)). It introduces support for .NET 8 and ARM64 builds. The new Color dialog allows you to pick alpha values. You can now open a new image window easily with 'File > New window.' It also offers the ability to disable menus, an 'EnableDebug' setting, and improved mouse click actions.


## Quick Setup Dialog
This version replaces the First-launch configurations with a user-friendly Out-of-box experience wizard. It includes two setting profiles for different user needs and allows you to control the Quick Setup dialog display.


## App Settings
You can now toggle the ImageGlass icon on the title bar with the new 'Show app icon on the title bar' setting. The UI for settings like `ImageInfoTags`, `EditApps`, `ToolbarButtons` and more has been enhanced for user convenience. File type associations settings are improved, and a "Get help" floating button provides quick access to documentation.

Additionally, the UI for `ZoomLevels` has been refined, and "ImageGlass" is no longer added to the file type when setting it as the default photo viewer.


## Gallery Component
ImageGlass 9.0 fixes issues related to the thumbnail cache, ensuring it doesn't reset and adheres to the specified size limit.
